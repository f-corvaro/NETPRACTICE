## Introduction

<p align="justify">
NetPractice is a technical project focused on developing and refining networking skills through practical exercises and scenarios. This designed to equip students with a profound understanding of network configuration and troubleshooting. 

</p>
<br>

### Overview 

<p align="justify">
The project covers a wide range of topics, including IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and network troubleshooting. You will have to configure small-scale networks, which requires a solid understanding of how TCP/IP addressing works. The project consists of 10 levels (i.e., 10 exercises) that you will complete and submit to your Git repository. The networks you will work with are not real; instead, they will be available via a training interface that you will access through your web browser. This setup allows for a controlled environment where you can practice and hone your networking skills. The purpose of this project is to solve networking problems and ensure the smooth operation of a network.

## Project Requirements - Mandatory Part

### Getting Started

<p align="justify">
First, download the project file from Intra page or directly from [this link](https://github.com/f-corvaro/NETPRACTICE/blob/main/resources/net_practice.1.5.tgz). Next, extract the files to a folder of your choice. In this folder, open the `index.html` file. This will launch the interface in your web browser:

<p>

### Training Levels

<p align="justify">
The training consists of ten levels, each presenting a non-functioning network diagram. At the top of your window, you will see the goal for each level, outlining the issues you need to resolve to ensure the network operates correctly. You have two main buttons at your disposal:

- **Check again**: Verifies whether your configuration is correct.
- **Get my config**: Downloads your current configuration, which is essential for submitting your assignment.

Upon successfully completing a level, a new button will appear, allowing you to proceed to the next level. Before advancing, remember to export your configuration using the **Get my config** button and save it to your Git repository.

At the bottom of the page, you will find logs that can help you understand why your configuration might be incorrect. To succeed, modify the unshaded fields until your network configuration is correct.

To complete this assignment, it is strongly recommended to understand how addressing works in a network, especially with devices such as routers. Make sure to read about TCP/IP addressing.

## Evaluation Process

### Peer-Evaluations

<p align="justify">
Submit your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Double-check the names of your files to ensure they are correct.

Since there are 10 levels in the training interface, you need to submit 10 files in your repository (one file per level). Place them at the root of your repository. Make sure to enter your login in the training interface and export a file per level using the **Get my config** button. It is crucial that you enter your login in the interface.

During the defense, you will be required to successfully complete 3 random levels as specified on the training platform. You will have a limited time to do so. The use of external tools is not allowed during your evaluation. However, the use of a simple calculator such as `bc` is tolerated but will be the limit. 

`bc` is a command-line calculator that supports arbitrary precision arithmetic. It is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. `bc` stands for "basic calculator" and can handle complex mathematical expressions, including floating-point calculations, making it a useful tool for quick computations directly from the terminal.

```bash
# Start bc in interactive mode
bc

# Perform a calculation
scale=2
5 / 3

# Output: 1.66
```
